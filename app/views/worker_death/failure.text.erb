Hello,

One of the <%= Rails.env %> warehouse workers has encountered an unexpected database problem:
  <%= @exception.message %>

This may indicate a persistent database issue, and the worker has been shut down to prevent polution of the deadletters queue.

1) Resolve the database issues
2) <%= WarehouseTwo::Application.config.worker_death_restart %>

Thank you
